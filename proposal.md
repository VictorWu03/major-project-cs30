#Project Proposal

## Description

I am intending on creating an ai for tic tac toe and eventually applying that knowledge to gomoku which is a larger scale game

## Need to have

- Win detection i.e. horozontal, vertical, and diagonal
- Player vs. player mode (Gomoku)
- Option for player to select between playing against another human or playing against the computer
- Basic AI for Gomoku - have the computer alternate moves with the player 

## Nice to have

- Player vs. computer mode - using minimax/generating score based on board state (gomoku)
- Improving computer decisions using recursion and increasing the search depth to generate "smarter" moves
- Imporved interface features
