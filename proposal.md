#Project Proposal

## Description

I am intending on creating the game Gomoku. The goal of the game is to connect 5 in a row on an 18 by 18 grid. Similarly to tic tac toe, you can win by connecting 5 in a row horozontally, vertically, and diagonally. There will be options to play against another player or playing against the computer. 

## Need to have

- Win detection i.e. horozontal, vertical, and diagonal
- Player vs. player mode (Gomoku)
- Option for player to select between playing against another human or playing against the computer
- Basic AI for Gomoku - have the computer alternate moves with the player 

## Nice to have

- Player vs. computer mode - have the computer make moves by evaluating the board state. This will be done by giving a score to each board state.
- Improving computer decisions using recursion and increasing the search depth to generate "smarter" moves
- Improved interface features
