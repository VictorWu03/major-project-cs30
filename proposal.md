#Project Proposal

## Description

I am intending on creating an ai for tic tac toe and eventually applying that knowledge to gomoku which is a larger scale game

## Need to have

- Win detection i.e. horozontal, vertical, and diagonal
- Player vs. player mode (Gomoku)
- Player vs. player mode (tic tac toe)
- Player vs. computer mode - using minimax algorithm (tic tac toe)
- Outline of how to apply the same ai logic to gomoku

## Nice to have

- Player vs. vomputer mode - using minimax/generating score based on board state (gomoku)
- Imporved interface features
